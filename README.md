## COURSE REQUIREMENTS

**Attendance** </br>
Attendance is required and will be recorded. Excused absences (religious or medical, noted in via email to professor prior to absence occuring) accompanied by proper documentation can be granted. </br>
**Homework** </br>
Homework will be assigned periodically. All problem sets are expected to be completed according to the instructions, and they are usually due in one week after the assignment. Discussion of homework problems among students is permitted, but each student must finish his/her homework independently. Homework submissions are expected to be in a neat and complete form, showing all major steps towards the solutions. </br>
**Project** </br>
The term project is to provide you an opportunity to investigate a specific topic in the area of image processing and coding. The projects are to be conducted in groups, each with ~2-3 students. A list of suggested project topics will be provided around the third week. Each group will select its topic, and some creativity and imagination are encouraged. Each team project will be concluded with a 5-page report which describes the nature of your work, and a 10-15 min. computer demo to show your results. </br>
**Exams** </br>
There will be a midterm exam and a final exam. They are both open-book/open-notes exams. No communication is allowed among students in this class during the exams.

## GRADING PROCEDURES

Grades will be based on: </br>
Homework          (20%) </br>
Term Project      (20%) </br>
Exam I (midterm)  (30%) </br>
Exam II (final)   (30%) </br>

Late Policy: </br>
To encourage you to stay on schedule, due dates have been established for each assignment; 20% of total points will be deducted for assignments received 1-6 days late; assignments more than 1 week late will receive 0 points. Extensions and exceptions can be graded for appropiate reasons.

### LEARNING ACCOMODATIONS

Stevens Institute of Technology is dedicated to providing appropriate accommodations to students with documented disabilities. The Office of Disability Services (ODS) works with undergraduate and graduate students with learning disabilities, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorders, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, psychiatric disorders, and other such disabilities in order to help students achieve their academic and personal potential. They facilitate equal access to the educational programs and opportunities offered at Stevens and coordinate reasonable accommodations for eligible students. These services are designed to encourage independence and self-advocacy with support from the ODS staff. The ODS staff will facilitate the provision of accommodations on a case-by-case basis. </br>
*Disability Services Confidentiality Policy* </br>
Student Disability Files are kept separate from academic files and are stored in a secure location within the Office of Disability Services. The Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g; 34CFR, Part 99) regulates disclosure of disability documentation and records maintained by Stevens Disability Services. According to this act, prior written consent by the student is required before our Disability Services office may release disability documentation or records to anyone. An exception is made in unusual circumstances, such as the case of health and safety emergencies. </br>
For more information about Disability Services and the process to receive accommodations, visit [this site](https://www.stevens.edu/office-disability-services). If you have any questions pleasecontact: Phillip Gehman, the Director of Disability Services Coordinator at Stevens Institute ofTechnology at pgehman@stevens.edu or by phone (201) 216-3748. </br>

### INCLUSIVITY

*Name and Pronoun Usage*
As this course includes group work and in-class discussion, it is vitally important for us to create an educational environment of inclusion and mutual respect. This includes the ability for all students to have their chosen gender pronoun(s) and chosen name affirmed. If the class roster does not align with your name and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor of the necessary changes. </br>
*Inclusion Statement* </br>
Stevens Institute of Technology believes that diversity and inclusiveness are essential to excellence in academic discourse and innovation. In this class, the perspective of people of all races, ethnicities, gender expressions and gender identities, religions, sexual orientations, disabilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, and nationalities will be respected and viewed as a resource and benefit throughout the semester. Suggestions to further diversify class materials and assignments are encouraged. If any course meetings conflict with your religious events, please do not hesitate to reach out to your instructor to make alternative arrangements. </br>

You are expected to treat your instructor and all other participants in the course with courtesy and respect. Disrespectful conduct and harassing statements will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary actions.

### MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES

Part of being successful in the classroom involves a focus on your whole self, including your mental health. While you are at Stevens, there are many resources to promote and support mental health. The Office of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) offers free and confidential services to all enrolled students who are struggling to cope with personal issues (e.g., difficulty adjusting to college or trouble managing stress) or psychological difficulties (e.g., anxiety and depression). Appointments are strongly encouraged and can be made by phone (201-216-5177) or in-person (on the 7th floor of the Howe Center). CAPS is open from 9:00 am – 5:00 pm Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays and from 9:00 am – 7:00 pm on Tuesdays during the Fall and Spring semesters.

### EMERGENCY INFORMATION

In the event of an urgent or emergent concern about the safety of yourself or someone else in the Stevens community, please immediately call the Stevens Campus Police at 201-216-5105 or on their emergency line at 201-216-3911. These phone lines are staffed 24/7, year round. Other 24/7 resources for students dealing with mental health crises include the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) and the Crisis Text Line (text “Home” to 741-741). If you are concerned about the wellbeing of another Stevens student, and the matter is not urgent or time sensitive, please email the CARE Team at care@stevens.edu. A member of the CARE Team will respond to your concern as soon as possible.
